Arthur Hayes serves as the CEO of BitMEX and obtained his BA in Economics at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania in 2008. Subsequently he moved to Hong Kong where worked as an equity derivatives trader for Deutsche Bank and Citigroup for 5 years. Arthur made markets on the Hong Kong and Singapore stock exchanges on 50+ Exchange Trade Funds (ETFs).

After leaving Citi in 2013, Arthur began trading and investing in Bitcoin. He primarily engages in arbitrage between different spot exchanges, and between Bitcoin derivatives. After trading Bitcoin derivatives on various exchanges for some time, he thought that there is space for a Bitcoin derivative exchange modelled after existing exchanges where fiat currency derivatives are traded. Along with two other individuals, Arthur helped found BitMEX - Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange. BitMEX is currently in development and aims to be the exchange where professional investors trade Bitcoin derivatives.

Once the exchange is up and running, Arthur’s primary responsibility will be to market make futures and options on Bitcoin vs. fiat currency. From his past experience market making ETFs, Arthur hopes to help foster a liquid market place where investors, hedgers, and arbitrageurs can trade and exchange Bitcoin risk.
