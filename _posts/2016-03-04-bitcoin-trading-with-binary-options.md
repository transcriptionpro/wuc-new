<p>If you're unfamiliar with Bitcoin, the latest types of trading should be enough to get you interested. Along with binary trading, it is becoming the mainstream. In fact, <a href="http://www.anyoption.com/bitcoin-options">bitcoin trading with binary options is quite simple</a>.

<p>Before analyzing this new type of trading, let’s take a look at what Bitcoin actually is.

<h2 id="what">What is Bitcoin?</h2>

<p>Bitcoin is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency">digital currency</a>. Its creation and transfer is based on an open source encryption protocol. Bitcoin’s popularity is ever-growing and is accepted by many businesses and individuals.

<p>In other words, it’s a virtual alternative to “real” money. The concept makes a lot of sense. After all, money is no longer symbolic of actual gold in storage, and very often, we use it on an entirely cashless basis.

<p>Bitcoin is a currency perhaps better suited to the modern day. Trading on its value is the logical progression.

<h2 id="binary">What are binary options?</h2>

<p>If you know all about binary options, skip to the next section of this article. If not, this is what you need to know.

<p>Binary options refer to an all-or-nothing decision. Instead of buying and selling assets, with your trade hinging on the changing price of those options, you stake your money on whether the price will rise at all, or fall. You predict either <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/exam-guide/cfa-level-1/derivatives/options-calls-puts.asp">“Call” or “Put”</a>, the only two options available.

<p>The “Call” option predicts that the price of the asset will rise. The “Put” option predicts that the price of the asset will fall. If it goes your way, you earn. If not, you lose.

<h2 id="trading">Bitcoin trading with binary options</h2>

<p>Quite simply, Bitcoin trading with binary options refers to betting on whether the Bitcoin price will go up or down when paired with the US$.

<p>Binary Options are popular, partly because they are easy to use and don’t require a lot of maintenance. You don’t need to follow every fluctuation in price, as you're only invested on the value going up or down.

<p>So too, Bitcoin trading with binary options is quite simple. You simply call or put on Bitcoin, input the amount you're investing and the time frame over which you're predicting, and choose the instruments you're using.

<h2 id="earn">How much can you earn?</h2>

<p>Binary options can earn you a lot of money. You also stand to lose your entire investment. If the price goes beyond your target price when choosing a call option, you'll get up to 85% ROI. If not, you'll lose 100% of your investment.

<p>This is the downside to binary options, with Bitcoin or any other trades. Instead of risking devaluation of your money, you're risking it all. However, it is not as risky as trading on leverage, for example, with which you stand to lose more than you invested.

<h2 id="started">Get started now</h2>

<p>Binary Options trading is simple, and can be accessed by beginners and experts alike. Trading on Bitcoin is as simple as any other currency or asset. This seems to be the future of trading, and it’s certainly worth a look.
