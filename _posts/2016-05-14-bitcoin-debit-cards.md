<p>Although the newest Bitcoin debit card, <a href="https://bitpay.com/visa/">BitPay's VISA card</a> is perhaps the most exciting of the bunch. It is the first Bitcoin debit card that is available to US residents from all 50 states.

<p>Unlike Shift's debit card (featured below), deposits lock in value in dollars. Shift's debit card spends directly from your Coinbase balance, which creates an accounting nightmare for capital gains taxes when it comes time to file. 

<p><h2 id="xapo">Xapo Debit Card<h2>
