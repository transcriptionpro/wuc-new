<p>Although the newest Bitcoin debit card, <a href="https://bitpay.com/visa/">BitPay's VISA card</a> is perhaps the most exciting of the bunch. It is the first Bitcoin debit card that is available to US residents from all 50 states.
<p>BitPay's debit card costs $9.95 to order, and arrives 7-10 days after purchase. It can be used online, in-person, and also works with any ATM that works with VISA cards.
<p>Unlike Shift's debit card (featured below), deposits lock in value in dollars. Shift's debit card spends directly from your Coinbase balance, which creates an accounting nightmare for capital gains taxes when it comes time to file.

<p><h2 id="avoid">Services To Avoid</h2>
<p><b>BitPlastic</b> - was among the first Bitcoin debit cards. However, they do not appear to be innovating much.
<p>Supposedly they are TOR compatible but I get strange error messages whenever I try to use their services. <b>Perhaps I have too much cybersecurity on my computer for them!!</b>
<p>Additionally, many websites may fail to process a card with no-name. And if you lose your card then you have lost your funds so be extra careful!
<p><b>E-Coin/Wirexapp</b> - The signup process was extremely poor and required a phone verification. Then the account did not even function properly. So I am not sure they even offer a legitimate Bitcoin debit card at all. So just steer clear of these guys.
