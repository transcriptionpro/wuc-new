Brian Donegan is the business development manager for the Isle of Man government. He has been instrumental in bringing Bitcoin and cryptocurrency businesses to the Isle of Man.

On April 1st, 2015, the Isle of Man's Bitcoin specific legislation, the [Proceeds of Crime Act](/assets/pdf/proceeds-of-crime-act-isle-of-man-bitcoin.pdf), went into effect which has created a very friendly environment for legitimate businesses on the island and was specifically tailored to (1) protect customer funds and (2) keep crime out.
