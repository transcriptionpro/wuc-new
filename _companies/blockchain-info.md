Blockchain.info is a popular Bitcoin web wallet and block explorer. 

## Block Explorer

Blockchain.info is the most widely used Bitcoin block explorer. Its [Alexa ranking](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/https%3A%2F%2Fblockchain.info) is 2,584, making it not only one of the largest Bitcoin websites, but also one of the largest websites in general. 

## Wallet

Blockchain.info's web wallet is one of the most popular Bitcoin wallets in the world. More than seven million accounts had been created as of May 13, 2016:

Although a popular wallet, Blockchain.info has had numerous problems. In February 2015, malicious Tor exit nodes were [able to steal](http://www.bitcoinaffiliatenetwork.com/blog/bryan/how-hackers-used-tor-to-rob-blockchain-info-and-localbitcoins-users/) over $50,000 worth of bitcoins from blockchain.info users. In [December 2014](http://cointelegraph.com/news/johoe-strikes-again-lifts-more-than-300-bitcoins-from-secure-wallets), weak RNG would have cost Blockchain.info users 300 BTC. Luckily, Bitcoin hacker JoeHoe discovered the weak RNG and stole the bitcoins before hackers to reach them. 

For this history of problems, Blockchain.info is not featured on [bitcoin.org's wallets page](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet).
