<h3 id="mobile">Best Mobile Bitcoin Wallets</h3>

<p>iPhone and Android apps are available with popular choices including:</p>

{% for wallet in site.data.wallets %}
{% if wallet.tags contains 'mobile' and wallet.tags contains 'start' %}
{% include wallet_list.html %}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

<p><h3 id="best-bitcoin-wallets">Best Bitcoin Software Wallets</h3>
<p>Bitcoin software wallets are downloaded to your computer, give you more control and do not depend on third-party services. Most software bitcoin wallets require a day or so to download the blockchain before they are ready for use.</p>

{% for wallet in site.data.wallets %}
{% if wallet.category == 'desktop' and wallet.tags contains 'start' %}
{% include wallet_list.html %}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

<p><h3 id="hybrid">Best Hybrid Bitcoin Wallets</h3>
<p>Hybrid Bitcoin allow you to both control the private keys and have the easy of use of a web wallet.</p>

{% for wallet in site.data.wallets %}
{% if wallet.tags contains 'hybrid' and wallet.tags contains 'start' %}
{% include wallet_list.html %}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

<p><h3>Best Bitcoin Web Wallets</h3>
<p>Bitcoin web wallets are the easiest and most convenient to use but are potentially less secure than the above options because the private keys to your bitcoins are usually held by a third-party.
<p>Due to the large number of security breaches where people have lost bitcoins, we do not recommend any of the current Bitcoin web wallets. A wallet like <a href="https://copay.io/">Copay</a> can be used on mobile & desktop. It provides the benefits of a software wallet and is easy to use across many devices. Copay also helps you securely share wallets with other people.

<h3>Best Bitcoin Hardware Wallets</h3>
<p>Bitcoin hardware wallets are the most secure because they do not expose your private keys to the network.</p>

<p>So this is exactly the typical sign as you can also find on the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Promotional_graphics">Bitcoin Wiki</a>. Just that it is in fully scalable PSD form so even blowing it up to huge printable resolutions will do no harm to them. And you can edit them easily.
<p>All images have transparent corners.
