<p>Here is the deal:
<p>Major fortunes, millions of dollars in some cases, have been made and lost with alt-coins. So, it might be in your interest to keep reading and then continue with your <a href="/what-is-cryptocurrency/">research of the alt-coins</a> and <a href="/what-is-an-application-coin/">application coins</a>.
<p>Bitcoin was the category creator of crypto-currency and got everyone excited with huge movements in the <a href="/en/bitcoin-price/">Bitcoin price</a>. That is what happens when it goes from $0.05 to $1,200 in four years. Millionaires get minted!
<p>With the initial innovation has come an explosion of <em>'alt-coins'</em>. Bitcoin is considered a SHA-256 coin because it uses that algorithm for the <em>proof of work</em> component.
<p>Other alt-coins use different algorithms such as scrypt, X11, X13, X15, NIST5 and 100% proof of stake. Often the developers of alt-coins are seeking to develop some new innovation that makes it more useful to market participants.
<p>Alt-coins have traditionally been extremely volatile in price which seems to draw speculators. So far we have only included a few of the 600+ alt-coins so we hope you find the resource pages useful!
